pd-aubio contains various externals for PureData based on the aubio library.

For more information, see:
  - aubio homepage: http://aubio.org
  - puredata homepage: http://puredata.info

Building
--------

To build everything, run the usual:

  $ ./configure && make 

Alternatively, you can use waf. For instance, to build against aubio installed
in /var/tmp/aubio:

  $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/var/tmp/aubio/lib/pkgconfig waf \
      distclean configure build install --prefix=/var/tmp/aubio 

Installing
----------

To install the aubio external for puredata on your system, run the following as
root:

  # make install

Running
-------

To load the external, start pd as follows

  $ pd -lib aubio

If you want to use the external without installing it, the above command should
work as expected from the pd-aubio source directory. If needed, set your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the path to the aubio library.
